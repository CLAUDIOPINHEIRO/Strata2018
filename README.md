# Get Started with Data Science Experience

Description: Follow this lab and perform hands on exercises with IBM Data Science Expereince (DSX).  Data Science Experience allows you to easily develop and share a model that scales using Apache Spark, Python or RStudio.

After signing up for a DSX you can choose to test out SPSS Modeler flows or a Jupyter notebook.
