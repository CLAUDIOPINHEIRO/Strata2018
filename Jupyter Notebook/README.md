# Predict quality of the connection

In this lab we will try to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections. 

## Data
Today we are using data set from UCI.This dataset was used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. This dataset contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.
